            <h2>Home Page &ndash; Introduction</h2>
            <h3>What is the course about?</h3>
            <p>This course is about learning how to solve real-world problems by designing and implementing algorithms. It teaches how to use the right data structures and techniques to make systems efficient and effective.</p>

            <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h3>
            <p>In the course, we explored many data structures and algorithms that helped us create an E-Bike Management System. For example, arrays were used to manage docking station information, while dynamic lists (vectors) handled user data like invoices and feedback. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between docking stations, making navigation smooth and efficient. Sorting methods like quicksort helped organize invoices, and binary trees were great for managing user feedback in a structured way.</p>

            <p>We also applied ideas like simulating bike availability to reflect real-world challenges, using random number generation to predict changes in docking stations. Techniques like edge relaxation, borrowed from graph algorithms, helped optimize routes. Overall, we combined these concepts to build a practical, scalable solution.</p>

            <h3>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</h3>
            <p>This course directly relates to solving real-world problems, especially in transportation and urban mobility. For instance, the algorithms we used, like Dijkstra's for route optimization, are the same ones used in GPS systems to calculate the fastest route. Feedback management through trees is similar to how customer reviews are handled in apps like Amazon. Our approach to simulating bike availability mirrors inventory tracking systems used by ride-sharing platforms. This course has shown how powerful algorithms and data structures can be applied to make transportation systems smarter, greener, and more user-friendly.</p>

            <h2>Course Project Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Details of the Problem Space and How It Was Arrived At:</h3>
            <p>Our project started by analyzing common challenges in urban mobility. We noticed problems like traffic congestion, last-mile connectivity issues, and inefficient bike-sharing systems in cities. After studying commuter patterns and city design, we found that docking stations often face overcrowding or empty racks during peak hours. Users also struggled with a lack of real-time updates and user-friendly systems.</p>

            <p>We identified opportunities to improve docking station management, reduce waiting times, and make the user experience seamless. By integrating features like real-time bike tracking, automated reports, and a feedback system, we created a solution that addresses these challenges. The business potential lies in better resource allocation, user satisfaction, and scalable systems for expanding cities.</p>

            <h3>Problem Definition and Team Details:</h3>
            <p>The goal of our project was to build a smart and efficient E-Bike Management System. The system needed to improve bike availability, optimize docking station usage, and reduce user frustrations. We focused on creating features like bike rentals, returns, and premium subscriptions while ensuring the system could handle increasing demand.</p>

            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <p>Throughout this course, we gained deep insights into solving real-world problems using algorithmic thinking and practical implementations. The following points summarize our key learnings:</p>

            <h3>1. Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, and Backtracking</h3>
            <p>Nature often presents us with problems that require different approaches to solve. For example, iteration helps in handling repetitive tasks, like processing large datasets one step at a time. Recursion is ideal for problems that have a natural "divide-and-conquer" structure, like calculating Fibonacci numbers or solving the Tower of Hanoi. Backtracking shines in scenarios where we need to explore all possibilities, such as solving a Sudoku puzzle or navigating a maze.</p>

            <h3>2. Space and Time Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Space and time efficiency are at the heart of algorithm design. Time efficiency ensures tasks are completed quickly, while space efficiency ensures minimal memory usage. Problems are categorized based on their complexity, such as linear (O(n)), quadratic (O(n²)), or exponential (O(2^n)). Understanding these growth patterns helps us design scalable systems.</p>

            <h3>3. Hierarchical Data and Tree Structures</h3>
            <p>Trees and their variants (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees, and heaps) are powerful tools for managing hierarchical data. In our project, binary search trees helped us store and retrieve user feedback efficiently. Heaps were instrumental in prioritizing tasks, such as scheduling bike maintenance or managing peak usage hours. These structures ensure fast data retrieval and manipulation, which is crucial in real-time systems.</p>

            <h3>4. Array Query Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Array-based algorithms enabled us to handle frequent queries on docking station data, like checking bike availability or calculating usage statistics. Techniques like prefix sums and sliding windows optimized these operations, making the system responsive and efficient.</p>

            <h3>5. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort were essential for organizing user invoices and feedback. Searching techniques helped us locate specific data quickly, enhancing the overall user experience. These algorithms form the backbone of many system features.</p>

            <h3>6. Graph Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Graph algorithms, including Dijkstra's and Kruskal's, played a key role in optimizing routes between docking stations. They ensured users could find the shortest paths, reducing travel time and enhancing convenience.</p>

            <h3>Course Learning Reflections</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By analyzing the problem’s constraints and testing different strategies, the best algorithm is determined based on speed and memory usage.</li>
                <li>During the E-Bike Management System project, user-friendly features were balanced with system scalability by prioritizing core functionalities first.</li>
                <li>A solution is considered effective if it solves the problem, handles edge cases, and performs well under stress. For example, the shortest path algorithm was tested with both small and large datasets.</li>
                <li>Flexibility is essential when facing unforeseen challenges. For instance, an issue with bike availability simulations was addressed by switching to a randomization approach to mimic real-world conditions.</li>
                <li>Simplicity is prioritized for maintainability, as seen in features like user feedback. Optimization is reserved for performance-critical areas like routing.</li>
                <li>Decomposing the E-Bike System into user and admin modules made the development process smoother and more manageable.</li>
                <li>Trade-offs between solutions are identified by comparing options, such as Dijkstra’s (faster but requires non-negative weights) and Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights but slower).</li>
